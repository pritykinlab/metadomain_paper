# Metadomain_Paper

Welcome to the repository for **"Metadomain Genome Associations in Mammalian T Cells."** This repository contains the code, plots, and data used to generate the figures for the study, which explores the interactions of metadomains within the genome of mammalian T cells.

## Overview

This repository is organized to provide easy access to the resources used in generating the main and supplementary figures of the paper, as well as other specific analyses.

### Main and Supplementary Figures

- **Main Figures**: Most of the main figure plots can be found in the [`Final_Main_Figures.ipynb`](./Final_Main_Figures.ipynb) notebook.
- **Supplementary Figures**: Most of the supplementary plots are in the [`Final_Supplementary_Figures.ipynb`](./Final_Supplementary_Figures.ipynb) notebook.

### Specific Analyses

- **cABC Analysis**: Available in the [`cABC_analysis`](./cABC_analysis) folder.
- **Pileups**: Available in the [`pileups`](./pileups) folder.
- **ChIP-seq Compendium Analysis**: Available in the [`chip_compendium_analysis`](./chip_compendium_analysis) folder.
- **Hi-C Compendium / Metaloop Analysis**: Available in the [`hic_compendium_analysis`](./hic_compendium_analysis) folder.

### Intermediate Files

- Intermediate files used in the main figure plots, including metadomain calls, loops, etc., can be found in the [`intermediate_files`](./intermediate_files) folder.

### Code for Specific Tasks

- **Metadomain Calling**: Code to call metadomains can be found in the [`identify_metadomains`](./identify_metadomains) folder.
- **Metaloop Calling**: Code to call metaloops can be found in the [`hic_compendium_analysis/Final_Metaloops_Refine`](./hic_compendium_analysis/Final_Metaloops_Refine) folder.
- **Python Scripts**: Additional Python code used in the notebooks can be found in the [`code`](./code) folder.

### Large Files

- Large files, including mcool files and ChIP-seq data, are available on Google Drive.
