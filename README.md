# metadomain_paper
This GitHub has plots and code to generate figures for "Metadomain genome associations in mammalian T cells".

Most of the main figure plots can be found in "Final_Main_Figures.ipynb". 

Most of the supplement plots are in "Final_Supplementary Figures.ipynb". 

Other plots corresponding to specific analyses can be found elsewhere: 

cABC analysis : "cABC analysis" folder
Pileups : "pileups" folder
ChIP-seq compendium analysis : "chip_compendium_analysis" folder
Hi-C compendium / metaloop analysis : "hic_compendium_analysis" folder

Intermediate files used in the main figures plots, containing e.g. metadomain calls, loops, etc, can be found in the folder "intermediate_files"

Code to call metadomains can be found in "identify_metadomains"
Code to call metaloops can be found in "hic_compendium_analysis/Final_Metaloops_Refine"

Python code used in the notebooks can be found in "code/"

Large files (mcool files, and ChIP-seq data) can be found on google drive:
